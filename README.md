### Surgical Improvements Applied

1. **Label Smoothing (0.1)**: Prevents overconfidence and improves generalization
2. **Optimized Adam Parameters**: Beta values (0.9, 0.999) for stable convergence
3. **Enhanced Test-Time Augmentation**: 5 augmentations for inference-time boost
4. **Two-Phase Training**: Transfer learning followed by fine-tuning

### Architecture Details

- **Base Model**: MobileNetV2 (ImageNet pre-trained)
- **Input Size**: 128×128×3 (i3-optimized)
- **Classifier Head**: 
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D
  - BatchNormalization + Dense(256) + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)
  - BatchNormalization + Dense(128) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  - Dense(4) + Softmax

### Training Strategy

**Phase 1: Transfer Learning (30 epochs)**
- Freeze MobileNetV2 backbone
- Train classifier head only
- Learning rate: 1e-3
- Focus on domain adaptation

**Phase 2: Fine-tuning (25 epochs)**
- Unfreeze top 20 layers of backbone
